MATLAB CODE:

% Function: avrunprotocol_R_rounds - averages over multiple iterations of the hashing protocol
% For a single iteration of the protocol: We consider all # of rounds (R) between R=1 and R = n-1
% REQUIRES: opteps, runprotocol_R_rounds
% Input: n - number of copies
%        W - describes noisy state: W|phi+><phi+| + (1-W)id/4
%        epsilon - denotes the total error post-protocol
%        averageingover - # of iterations one averages over

% Output: avrank - average rank of the output state (up to smoothing)
%         avfid - average fidelity of output state
%         ranks - Records the rank of the output state for all iterations of the hashing protocol (For all R) 
%         Fidelities - Records the fidelity of the output state for all iterations of the hashing protocol (For all R)

function [avrank,avfid,ranks,Fidelities] = avrunprotocol_R_rounds(n,W,error,averageingover)
    eps1 = opteps(n,W,error);
    eps2 = error - eps1;
    p1 = (1+3*W)/4;
    p2 = (1-W)/4; 
    ranks = zeros(n-1,averageingover)
    Fidelities = zeros(n-1,averageingover)
    %for j = 1 : R
    for j = 1 : n-1
        for i = 1 : averageingover
            [ranks(j,i),Fidelities(j,i)]= runprotocol_R_rounds(n,W,error,j)
        end
    end
    avrank = mean(ranks,2);
